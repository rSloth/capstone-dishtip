       "  'text': 'It was an amazing experience! The service in this restaurant is the best from what I saw in Germany so far.\\n\\nThey proposed me to have an extra meal for free because I didn’t enjoy a soup (not because it was bad, but because it wasn’t for my taste). I said that I’ll take 2 oysters instead, and the waiter said he will bring 3 :) when he came back, he brought 4 oysters for me for free… I was amazed.\\n\\nAlso the waiters answered all our questions, were very nice and caring. It was such an experience. 💛',\n",

       "  'text': 'We visited Funky Fisch yesterday evening and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. The service was efficient and genuinely welcoming — despite arriving nearly 20 minutes late, we were greeted with warmth and made to feel at ease right away. The menu is concise, featuring a thoughtfully curated selection of dishes that makes choosing both straightforward and satisfying.\\nThe wine list is extensive, with an impressive array of non-alcoholic options as well. The food itself was outstanding — fresh, beautifully presented, and bursting with flavor. It’s the kind of place where, as you settle the bill, you’re already imagining your next visit and wondering about the dishes you didn’t try this time. Highly recommended!',\n",

       "  'text': 'The food was absolutely delicious. There was one English speaking waiter who made great recommendations.\\n\\nThe food is eclectic but everything makes sense together. We ordered a little too much but we were stuffed and happy.\\n\\nThe coffee and dessert were so delicious! I can highly recommend this restaurant and everything we ordered (see pic captions) was amazing!\\n\\nThis places is great for special celebrations as it is a little more pricey than what is normal in Berlin. We went to celebrate our friend’s birthday.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Great fish restaurant, food was delicious, maybe best popcorn shrimp ever.\\n\\nWas for a birthday dinner, so ready to splurge a bit. End to end everything was really good, the only area for improvement would be the daily fish board.\\n\\nAs only English speaker, this as you pick fish special was bit challenging to fully understand, even though the waiters were trying to explain, was just a bit difficult to translate it all via discussion. Which put a bit of a damper on the meal.\\n\\nWould still go back, and maybe second time that we know the score it would be better',\n",
