With kinza and hot pepper, if you know what i mean. Khachapuri imeruli and khinkali with cheese also 10/10.\\nIt seems like a georgian family is running the place, you can see georgian grandma cooking and kind georgian girls serving - this is the sign of quality ‚ù§Ô∏è\\n\\nPs. They had a window before on Kotti ring,  now it is a real dining experince, very nice!',\n",
